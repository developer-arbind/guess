      message: `Hey, Hello My name is Arbind. Just an ordinary student,
with an IQ of 144. (INTJ-T)
I have had no friends till now. So I just want to create some memories with someone who can understand me, and I can do so too. We have only had 11 months.
I just can't be someone's friend if she or he has a girlfriend or boyfriend.

(I am not comfortable in it)
So leave these things; I just don't like them.
I know I am sending it to you because I really like you. It's so rare for me to talk to anyone or give them such valuable time. If you receive it, you are lucky.
I know you may have some interest in your boyfriend. But I will be sure that, analyzing everything you said and your behavior, it won't seem that you have any feelings for him.
You just don't know what a relationship means. it not about you are the GF and he is Â BF. even as friends. You understand what it means.
So I just wanted to say, if you can't leave your boyfriend, I am just continuing to be alone and happy. I am not forcing you to do anything at all. If you have even a little feeling for me, just let me know. Then I will know I chose the right person. Just listen to your mind and heart and make the decision. If you want to experience something big and such as what you saw in a movie, Just be with me, and let's do something big together. I know you don't know anything about programming, but I'm not a finding a programmer, just the type of person with the mindset. (we have 11 months.)
Sorry for that unexpected behavior where I held your hand. I actually just don't want to see you fall from that. but after all, you proved me wrong. and btw it's may uncomfortable for you. (sorry 2x)
I don't say sorry; it's also super rare that I am saying it to someone.
So just leave your boyfriend He may waste your time, for sure.
Otherwise, I will not be there for you. Just go and enjoy with your BF. This is what I was saying.
If you understand my words, then just say what you have in mind. Say whatever you won't; I don't care much. Don't think I get hurt or something.
I'm waiting for your reply. I just want to hear your real thoughts. *be honest*

I know just everything what is a lie and what is a truth.`,
